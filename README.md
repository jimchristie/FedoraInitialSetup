# Linux Desktop Setup
This is a series of scripts that will set up a new Linux desktop the way that I like it.

It's fully functional on Fedora right now. It hasn't been tested on Ubuntu or Debian, but it should work there. No other distros are supported...yet.

My intention is to make it more flexible as I go along.

# Notes:

I highly recommend that you read through the scripts before using. They are set up for me. They likely do stuff that you don't want.
# Use with caution

# Dependencies
sudo: 	Not always installed in Debian distros.
git: 	It's the easiest way to download this, but not actually necessary.

# To use:
1. Download to your system.
2. Make init.sh executable.
3. Execute it with sudo.
