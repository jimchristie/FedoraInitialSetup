# Linux Desktop Setup
This is a series of scripts that will set up a new Linux desktop the way that I like it.

It's fully functional on Fedora right now. It hasn't been tested on Ubuntu or Debian, but it should work there. No other distros are supported...yet.

My intention is to make it more flexible as I go along.
